## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
The dataset we've chosen for our project was provided by the UK Department of Transport, and displays accidents and traffic flow in the United Kingdom. There are two categories involved in the dataset. The largest category, collected by the UK government from 2000-2016 demonstrates the "Average Annual Daily Flow", which measures the traffic activity in different regions and road types across the UK. The 2nd category exhibits data on accidents from 2005-2014 (2008 data missing). This category indicates the location, date, severity, number of vehicles, light and weather conditions ect. involved in a specific accident. The purpose of this dataset is to observe regions, road types or times of year (ect.) and predict accident rates or improve them over time. With this data one can observe how traffic flow affects accidents and perhaps produce ways of mitigating accident risk. The data on traffic flow was collected partially by manual count and partially by estimations of the AADF of previous years. The accident data was collected by digitized records of the accident's characteritics/location.

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
Using this data, we can examine differences in traffic accident rates among a variety of different conditions both environmental and artificial. For example, are accidents more commonplace during periods of high wind or wet road conditions? Does the time-of-day effect play a role in accident prevalence or severity and is this effected more by light conditions (i.e. daylight vs streetlight vs no light) or alertness of the driver, owing to the time of day? We can also examine things like speed limits or the type of road in assessing driver risk. It may be that higher speed leads to more severe accidents but fewer total accidents as they occur on straighter sections of road (or not!). Overall, the data seems well suited to the creation of visualizations and open to analyzation. By the end of the project, it may be possible for someone to filter the data by number of casualties by highway designation to deduce “The Most Dangerous Road in the UK” or any number of other interesting statistics or anomalies that present themselves.
