This *information* is only for **demonstration purposes**. Nevertheless, it shows my progress on Markdown knowledge I gained from this class.

Markdown used in this file:
- Multi-level Headers
- Bold Text
- Italic Text
- Ordered lists
- Images
- Horizontal line

```python
# Python code

s = "Python seems fun to work isn't it?"
print(s)
```
